The young man stood on the edge of platform overlooking the delta of the Nile. Worried and concerned, it's clear his attention was elsewhere.

"Chart course for Desouk, I have words for Geb, Nut, Seth and Ra. Summon the Great Council... they should bear witness." He instructed the slave to leave his presence. 

The jewelry stitched to his arm, rubbed against the cloth draped around his neck and waist. The rustle of the fabrics chimed a melodic tone. He was donning extortionate attire, barring no room for lesser-classmenship. His chariot awaited. Designed for horses his lineage selectively bred. The tamed-beast was ornamented with precious stones and jewels.

"Yaah!" He roars as the whip cracked. 

He prepared for inertia, a symptom of traveling at ferocious speeds, other symptoms include nausea and muscle fatigue. The horse neighs', springing in to an impetus march. A trek this exhaustive demanded many sharpened skills. Navigation in these conditions alone require a through mapping of night skies, weather patterns and local geology. The horse required methodical attention to avoid strain. Even with enough supplies, he knew the 35-days to follow were going to be brutal at best. But for the sake of his family, he had a responsibility.

On the fourteenth day, signs of a storm were at his tail, making steady way towards him. In need to pitch camp, he looked around. He found a cavernous break between two sand-eroded hills of rock. He pulled the right leash, forcing his horse to dive towards the debatable cavity. The storm came over them in no time. He got off his horse and anchored it to a neighboring rock. The sand around him became mud. A few steps over, hidden from sight, was the edge of a Herculean cliff. Valleys channeled out of mountainous plateaus in all directions. The sky above and the land between him and the plateau ahead was dark. Shadowed by the storm. If he looked far enough, he can see in to the future. Where the storm has not yet touched.

Egypt is not dry and dusty as one would imagine, its' land fertile, seas' enriched with eukaryotes.
