## Wampanoag
### North East America, c. 1421 A.D.E.S.

"Ilyare!" she screamed frantically. 

Ilyares' mom cradled her, holding the leather belt in her mouth. Her grinding teeth tearing at the buffalo hide. She began convulsing. To the tribe, Ilyare was cursed. Everyone thought that evil spirits would have their way with her when she was in this state.

Andyare, her mother, was in tears, gasping for deep breath. She pray the Gods relieve Ilyare of what she felt was punishment for her sins. Perhaps for abandoning prayer on occasion, committing adultery with the non-local. Is that not enough to force Gods' wrath? Leaving her with bastard child, barely able live on own.

"My Ilyare..." she sobs, holding her daughters' head tight, close to her anguished heart. 

Ilyare is 6-years-old. She was born comatose. Conceived on the same ground she lay today. A bed of leaves, roots and soil, atop the mountain overlooking their previous settlement. Minutes pass and then the thought crossed Andyares' mind. "What if Ilyare feels no pain? What if the pain in my heart, is the only pain between us. What if the Gods are only borrowing you? My sweet princess." 

"Your special mind." She whispers to her daughter.

Andyare gave in to that hope. That single ray of sun beyond a clouded sky. Dreaming. Entranced by the conviction that whatever is happening to Ilyare, is a part of a greater plan. With every moment that passed, Andyare held her daughter closer. The sun set 12° when Ilyare returned to her normal, non-convulsing, vegitative state. 

She lay still. In every sense of the word, nonplussed, by the world around her. Her mind wasn't there with mother. She was fixed to a lucid dream or reality outside everyone else's purview. Mother, folded over her daughter who lay moored to the earth. The sun bathed their skin as it crept through the canopy of leaves, branches and lush forestry surrounding them. It was quiet for that moment. No birds. No critters. No noise. Just them. 

Ilyares' body remained still, only occasional movement came from her eyes, from underneath her thin eyelids. As if she was in the REM cycle of a normal nights slumber. Her body from the chest down was apart of the earth. Her arms, from below the elbow, were tree roots, digging in to the earth. Andyare assumed that was how her body remained nourished, feeding on sugars in the earth. 

Ilyares' facial features closely resembled her mothers'. However, everything else seemed to be a genetic copy of her father. Her body was hairless, pale blue, with darker hues of stripes and markings around her face and arms. Her eyes, when she chose to open them, were as white as the sun. Her gills, clotted with dirt and dust.

Andyare looked up. Wondering what's become of Yårun. Her lover. He left this earth as fast as he came. Andyare is not bitter from his departure, just hoping for his safety and betterment. "He saved me." She thought. Unlike other women of her tribe, Andyare was weak, showing little-to-no signs of alphaism. She was the living epitome of a damsel in distress. Fonder of the men in the tribe, who gossiped, cooked and harvested plants while the women sought prey. 

Andyare also identified more with the male figure, small, petite and slim around the waist. Jokingly, the tribe referred to her as the linguistic equivalent of a man-girl. "T'sak-namarun". At age 9, she was already towered and overpowered by other females of her age. Her figure was uncommon for females from that specific lineage.

For centuries, the Heir-Chamarayan, a sect of the Wapanoag which she belonged to, chose to selectively breed women based on preferable traits like strategic depth, chauvanism, stregnth, loyalty and charisma. It is rumored that their culture originated in another part of the world, the Amazon. Their differences led to their exile, so they sought refuge in deep areas of uncharted forests.

Not before long, stories about the Heir-Chamarayan, like the Amazonian's before them, became a myth.

Andyare was frightened for her life. She stumbled her way to a clearing in the forest, dropping her shield along the way. Within seconds, the Hexaped-Apes surrounded her. She was only 10-years-old. She wondered why the Gods chose to make her a female, at least in the biological sense. As she reached for her gold-plated shield, the alpha male gnarled and barked at her. She retreated.

"Fuck, fuck. I'm dead..." she cowered. It was in all truth the most plausible scenario. As it is, roughly 20% of the women that undergo this test don't leave a body for their loved ones to bury, let alone her weak manly self. She back pedaled in to a stone wall. Cornered. In every sense of the word. The alpha began approaching her, with it, the rest of the pack sidled towards her. She covered her face and braced herself.

"Thwat, shkoom, thud." She peeked through a small opening in her fingers, she had no idea what was happening. She removed her hands from her face slowly. It was a blur of motions. What seemed like a blue, mysteriously shaped, figure, dishing out pain in ways she's never seen before. It was as if the figure was keen of the apes offensive and defensive mechanisms. It was a dance. She was enchanted, and before she knew it, she found her self awestruck, arms at her side, mouth wide-open and dry from disbelief.

The figure made no noise as it danced around the apes, using Andyares' shield both as a weapon and for self-defense. Its' precision was unlike anything she seen before. It used its' dexterous long toes to pick up a large rock at its' hind, while shielding a blow from the aplha ape ahead. It then jumped and kicked the aplha in the abdominal with the foot free of the rock, skillfully disabling the creature with no intent to kill it. In that single jump, it roundhouse-lunged the rock towards the beta ape almost 20 meters away. The ape was struck in the chest, flying back from the sheer force, knocking down a handful of other apes on it's way back.

With the alpha and beta apes unconscious, the pack retreated in fear. 

The figure then waited a moment, making sure the area was clear of all threats. Was it smelling the air? At arms length the figure loomed over her. It was narrow at its waist, but its' chest... its' chest was so wide. The creatures wingspan was longer than its' height. Its' torso was short. It was missing a naval cavity and nipples. 

The markings on its chest, arms and face pointed inward, like the stripes you would see on a tiger or zebra. Whatever it was, it wasn't human. The being turned to look over its' shoulder, nasal cavities flared, eyes wide and attentive. There was movement 30 meters across the field. It was the proctors. Andyare most definately failed the test; she didn't know what they were going to do with her. 

The being scratched a handful of letters in to the dirt between them, laid the shield on the floor then leaped towards the canopy, grappling onto the vines and branches, disappearing from sight without noise. She leaned in to read the note the being left behind, it was in her native tongue. How?

"Ya-arun"

Was that... its' name?

The rustling in the bushes grew closer. Andyare wiped the message away with her feet, grabbed her shield and prepared herself for the interrogation that will most definately follow.

She quickly snapped back in to reality when Ilyare began convulsing again. After a few tense spasms, Ilyare was still again, this time her eyes and mouth remained open. White  beams shot from her eyes, shooting towards the sky. Like thin pillars of light. Andyare followed the light to its peak. Dust and smoke swimming through it. Its' pinnacle aligned with the Orion constellation, barely visible in the young night sky.
