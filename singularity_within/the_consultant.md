## The Consultant
### I.S.S. DAWN, 27.02.3033

"C'mon! We saw this coming. This exact fucking..." 

"Sir, temper." Said the autonomous conflict resolution unit from the back of the room, cutting off the Program Director. 

"We were aware of this exact epic. We mapped every parallel universe, filtered scenarios selectively based on probability and deduction. As we expected, it was a chemical-based attack using multiple ballistic devices. Someone speak to this. Ñederes?" He directed to Ñederes, in a calmer voice.

"I'm not completely sure. The event branched as expected, completing a story that we mapped. It checked out milestone for milestone. But upon further inspection, there are some differences in the scenarios that were executed. Rather, some scenarios weren't used." She paused to think.

"It's not obtuse to assume the assassin, led us to prioritize a particular set of milestones. Thus, making us focus on certain stories. Leaving room to leverage scenarios from other stories that overlap in completing the milestone." Ñederes wasn't human, even though her suit shaped her to appear more human. When she spoke, she spoke to the listeners' mind.

"Are you suggesting that the terrorists have Atlassian technology? Or can out wit our quantum-computations? Gull the very likes of you?" barked the Director.

"They can't know of our existence because our objective requires that to persist in the true state. The second most-latter was discussed as a caveat in quantum-computational theory itself. Unfortunately my academic knowledge on this topic is limited. I suggest bringing a more scholarly resource on board." 

The director grunted in her direction. She stood up and held her right arm up towards him. She was tall, almost brutish. Her three, large, tentacle-like fingers hovered over the space above his head. She waited for his permission.

"Go on."

Ñederes is Hydaian, from the Taurus Constellation. She was the youngest Interstellar Fleet Graduate to become Executive Officer. Her first campaign was with Capitan Hendricks of the I.S.S Dawn. Nineteen months in to her first mission, routine operations aboard her vessel were interrupted. Dawn was a research facility in orbit around VY Canis Majoris, a hyper-giant star. The ship and its crew were currently occupied by the Galactic Archive and Intelligence Agency (GAIA). Ñederes and Captain Hendricks took orders from Program Director Charles Fredrich. 

Ñederes took Director Fredrich and Captain Hendricks to an event in the local time-space. A doctorate professor of Forensics focused in to their consciousness. The doctor that single-handedly brought the science of deduction to Forensics and Criminology. After his studies, he aided in theorizing the deductive-story model approach. The same methodologies used today as preventative measures for time-crimes by the Authority of Cross Time Dimensions (ACTD). The doctor had a name, but not one that everyone knew him by. Adoringly, he was referred to as Dr. Holmes.

"Since we first observed gravitational waves a little over a century ago, we revisited fundamental concepts of science in lieu of theories that will dramatically change our perception of the world around us. I have no doubt that *this* will play a huge role in the forthcoming revolution." Said the lecturer, holding a tiny chip.

"This quantum processor, matched with the right set of algorithms and conditionals, can recreate events at the sub-atomic level. Anyone care to take a stab at the possibilities this technology may lead to?" He asked the group of subjects staged for a virtual audience of roughly 500,000 people.

"Um... we can recreate events from the *future*?" Said a subject, unsure of the response. The crowd shared a brief, but loud, chuckle.

"I find it inspiring more-so than humorous." Retorted the professor, silencing the audience.

"What is time?" He continued. "To us, time behaves as an invisible force. There are laws and limitations to the ways in which it governs our existence. For centuries, we were aware of only *four* fundamental interactions determining how matter behaves in space..." Everyone buckled in for the whiplashing-climax of the lecture.

"...which brings us here today. We're aware of space-time and we know that gravity's role in space-time won't be replaced anytime soon, but how about another force? It's not far-fetched to assume there are quantum forces shaping the very fabric of our lives in a spectrum we cannot see." He paused.

"How do these forces fit in to our current models? Are we to ignore other factors that similarly govern matter at the subatomic-level? How does *this* force fit into our lives? Does it influence the past? The future?" He swept the audience with his eyes, smiling at the cost of their curiosity.

The room remained silent. The rhetorical questions made everyone think existentially. Time seemed to stand still. For a micro-second, everything was withdrawn from their attention, barring one very acute thought.

"Did anyone feel that? Did time seem to *stop* for anyone here?" He asked the subjects.

"Yes," as he focused his line of sight on the subject raising her hand, her name and additional information flooded the space to her right. "Yohanna."

"I don't know if time stopped, but for some reason, after your pause, I was communicated... *a single string* of thought. I felt it with everyone here... the audience... subjects... even... you." She looked to the other subjects seeking affirmation. They nodded and returned full attention to the lecturer.

"It was indeed 'A single string'." He gestured the words on to his desk as he spoke them. The words were then streamed to the digital board behind him for the audience to read. Suddenly, the vision they all shared seconds ago, came to shape before their eyes.

"I shared these exact words, this exact event, this exact moment, with the entire lot of you." The stunning revelation left everyone without breath. The subjects, in pure disbelief.

"Subjects, recall your study from 6 sols ago. After agreeing to partake in the remaining lectures, you completed a relatively-brief survey." He smiled in sarcasm. The survey took the better half of two hours to complete.

"In the fine-printed addendum to your waivers, there is mention of an experiment. A study that will conclude 6-decades of research using quantum-computation to refine models of the Ravnighat-Edstrom formula. In other words, for the purpose of our experiment, anticipate and share exactly *one* micro-second of the future."

Everyone, including Dr. Holme Sarkundar (Holmes), was taken aback. No one expected the experiment to provide such colorful results. Tangible data, in-the-flesh. He was ecstatic. These small wins reminded him that his work served a greater purpose, grand design. He gestured to another guest, hidden out of spot light. She hovered to the stage.

Dr. Alanis Pollux was his most enthused and respected under study. As she came in to spotlight, it became clear as to why she used the MIT Hoverchair. The entire lower half of her body, from her abdomen down was missing. The device allowed her to sit, stand, move around and work from the comfort of a single utility chair. It's aerodynamic aluminum body also conformed to her contour and style, safe to assume it was customized. 

"Please feel free to overwhelm Dr. Pollux with your questions and comments. After the convention, I will be available for book signings by the reception area. Thank you!" The croud gave him a standing ovation, as the press, alongside the virtual audience, began recapping the advancements detailed in this portion of the **ST2 Conference**. 

Dr. Sarkundar walked off stage, heading towards the green room to grab his belongings. He put on his coat and exited the convention center. He turned his coat collar against the wind, pulled out his nicotine-vaporizer and began to toke. He looked around the empty garden. The vapor replaced a fair portion of the oxygen in his lungs. The nicotine was digested by his lungs and spread throughout various cells, then carried up in to his brain. Neural receptors gladly accepted the cells' offerings. A deep breath later, his mind was clear of the frustrations and thoughts that would normally consume him.

Something wasn't right. At this hour, today of all days, the day his team unveiled the refined Ravnighat-Edstrom Space-Time (REST) Theory, he expected nonstop harassment from the press and amateur scientists alike. Especially in the public garden at Cambridge University. He walked towards the Stephen Hawking Center. Following the footsteps of the late astro-physicist, tracing the walls with his fingers, feeling the history deluge his emotions. "It's too quiet." He thought.

As he approached the steps of the monument honoring Dr. Hawking, his vision seemed to blur. He wiped his eyes dry of the tears caused by the cold wind. It took more than a few seconds for him to realize, but it wasn't his vision that was blurring. The matter that made up the space around him began fizzling in and out of existence. In unison, everything around him seemed to be vibrating.

Dr. Sarkundar fell to his knees, shielding his eyes from the blinding light leaking from a single point a few meters ahead of him. His coattail riding in the wave of energy. He dropped his vaporizer. The light began to consume the space around him and before he knew it, he was in a purgatorial state. He looked up to see three unrecognizable figures before him.

"Hello, Doctor Holmes"

<!--

Dr. Sarkundar used a Highlighter to direct the subjects' attention to a projection on his left. The highlighter used visible-electromagnetic waves to envelop an object that is defined when the user focuses their sans-peripheral vision. It was a single helix of DNA, amongst a table of two rows and eight columns. There was a DNA hologram for each of the 16 subjects of the experiment. 

He continued to explain how the survey completed earlier provided a deductive-traceback for each of the participants, agnostically, respective to their individual lives. He magnified parts in the helix, that were molded by their experiences. He factored the aforementioned variables in to Edstrom equations, a scale that seemed infinite. For the sake of brevity, he withdrew the excruciating detail behind his calculations. Dr. Sarkundar took a seat, allowing Dr. Priyanka Ravnighat to take the stage and expand on a field she lead.

"Not long ago, a physician stumbled upon inadmissible evidence suggesting we live in a universe governed by super-string theory. Now, it's the very backbone of every major scientific-breakthrough, religion and philosophy. Our star-faring capability is burgeoning, yet we've seen exponential growth in day-to-day and military technology. Collectively, we have a stable economy, a democratic state, tell-tale signs of a civilization that will evolve past Level-0" She paused. Meeting everyone's eye to make sure she is being understood. 

"Every single experience, every charged or non-charged particle, every photon of light or absence, plays a *major* role in defining how space and time is perceived. Ripples tracing back to very factors  that compose society, civilization, *this* moment at the sub atomic-level." Another strategic pause.
