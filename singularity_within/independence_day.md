## Independence Day
### Detroit, 04.07.2776

Today marks one-thousand years of independence in the United States. 

In its' usual tradition, the city of Detroit will echo with fireworks for a 10-kilometer radius. Towering buildings and tunneled roads will amplify the sound, causing bystanders to comfortably drop their guards to what normally induces fight or flight. The explosions alone hide a profusion of circumstances in plain sight. 

"...a special thanks to our sponsors: Bell-Telecomunnications, Bard Motor Company and the John & Johnson Family Company. Without further ado, Mayor Joseph Loppel."  The crowd applauds and the speaker disappears in blackout. By the other end of the dock, a single podium on a smaller stage lights up.

"Good evening." He spoke, breaking cheers.

"I would like to take a moment and extend my gratitude for all your support. We're all aware of the changes brought forth by the last few decades, but those eggs we cracked, made us a pretty sweet omelette, wouldn't you say?" He smiled and paused for the arc in their laugh to peak. Mayor Loppel was by far the most charismatic rightist politician on the news. Regardless of his partisanship, the very fiber of his being swayed the crowds' reverence.

"In the face of adversity and war *we* were resilient. When the responsibility to rebuild our nation was staring at us head on, *we* welcomed the challenge. That's why tonight, here at the Bard memorial in downtown Detroit, *we* remain standing on the grounds that revolutionized transportation eight-hundred and twenty-five years ago. That's why today, Motor City retains frontier-ship of the automative and space-faring industries." The crowd roars. Socialites and non-conformists alike seemed to be awestruck by the light of justice, silhouetting this hero.

He smiles and gestures order. "Let us awe at a sky of bursting fireworks, celebrate our independence, and shine feeble in light of our future." 

With those last words Mayor Loppel took a seat with the rest of his cabinet members. A long whistle, then a tiny pop.
 
Three seconds later, a fusillade of fireworks filled the eager silence, retaining everyones attention. While the public occupied the boardwalk, the Mayor, attending founders and board members spectated from within the necessary protection of a clarion shield.

The show ended with a final barrage of explosions. 

Mayor Loppel, alongside his cohorts, lay pulseless in their seats. Their skin wrinkled, like tarnished leather fused with dry muscle and bone. The shield was intact, but all life within ceased in the same gruesome manner. It wasn't painful, just not pretty. It intended to raise neck-hairs, induce goosebumps at the very least.

I smile. Impressed with my work.

I remind myself of how we choose to uphold a tradition that honors the mutilation and displacement of millions of people. I understand the difficulty in expressing empathy when subconsciously glued to our own interests and blind to the very hand that halts evolution. We placed ourselves at the center of the universe. What happened at the Library of Alexandria, Yucatan, China and Egypt before then only served as dry crops for the flame.

> History is written by those that live to make it. 

In simply staring at the floor behind me - a rooftop muddled with pebbles, mostly black, some reds, greens and in betweens - I know that every other arrangement of this seemingly random pattern exists for *this exact one* to exist. If the right people, at the right time, were to understand this simple, yet radical thought, maybe violence wouldn't be necessary. Maybe we'd be connected on a level beyond the surface, beyond blood.

I scoff at the by-product of evolution we call "self". A sense that is washed and cradled, only to later behave through a means of deeply-rooted calculations, unbeknownst to the host. Our ancestors would be ashamed at how much we've regressed. Does being aware make any difference?

Within seconds of asking herself that question, Jaya's mind raced with a million thoughts. She was overwhelmed, confused. "Wait!" She exclaims. "I'm talking to myself again... No... no, no." She starts pacing. "Not. This. Again." Stomping to emphasize each word, kicking up dust. 

She falls back from the ledge, finding difficulty to breathe. She disarms her weapon, tosses it over her right shoulder. The holster on her back sent a pulse to the registered weapon. It securely folded and snapped into a retro-fitted compartment, alongside a cache of weapons, gadgets and utilities. Hunched over her knees, she begins to hyper-ventilate.

The HUD readings were making her head spin. She takes off her helmet. It hisses and parts down the middle. The brute caliber of artillery and armor that plated her chest, back and limbs begin to frighten her. Desperately, she starts prying her suit open. Having no recollection of how to use it anymore, she used her weight as leverage to tear the chest away, further compromising pressure-integrity in the process. 

Her instincts told her to look for something behind the left abdomen. She feels around to find an object welded in to her bone. Above scar tissue, around the cavity, she felt a barcode of sorts. She traced it with her fingers, right-to-left. The embossed skin glowed from within. Sending a shock through her spine. 

"Argh... Aahh!!!" She screamed.

Her senses were hijacked momentarily. Her vision was obstructed with an opaque overlay. It prompted for a password. Without understanding how, her muscle memory gestured an accepted signature.

She felt a rush of information flooding her brain. Her senses, felt as if they were reviving from shell-shock. She looked up at the bay to notice panic spread throughout the audience. By then, authorities should have discovered a gap in their Closed Circuit Television recordings. There was 10-seconds of loop in place of what should've been signs of struggling for air. 

Jaya grabs her helmet and jumps in to the suit, leaps off the roof before the armor even solidifies around her. She lands on her toes, rippling the concrete below her. She crosses the sidewalk and enters her vehicle from the cargo area in the rear. A Chevron Puma, an armored truck with a programmable interface. To anyone else, it's just a beautiful machine. To Jaya, the vehicle was a partner, a spirit by the name of Leon. The locks clasp. The room is depressurized. Jaya takes off her helmet, kneels before it and the cocoon, resting her head on her knee.

"ID: Mars, Tango. Unit 781. Contact: Base." She spoke in to her chest. Microseconds later, her identification was confirmed, and an automated response system prompted her:  

"Report."

"Mission: Sierra, Papa, India, dash, two-two-nine-six." She sighed.

"Complete."

Leons' hind legs parted from the sides and kicked off the floor. Scaling walls and leaping beyond the roofs, then sky-scrapers. After clearing the blast radius, he folds his legs under him, tucks his head under his shoulder blades, then shot towards the stars. He left behind a ring of smoke and sonic tail. Jaya and Leon were heading towards high earth orbit, rendezvousing with other Descendants.

We waited for each other. We shared memories and emotions across gaps in space and time. So much time passed until the first descendant understood the gravity of this discovery. Our alienating conditions, are actually a gift from evolution. The underlying lesson being that evolution requires sacrifices. To a species that's not driven by emotion, sacrifices equate to death, but our survival was stringent on chaotic misfortune and selective breeding.

The Revan-Edstrom Experiment specifically was the first secretive experiment to be documented and discussed openly during its time. Its almost impossible that a revelation would mark the latter half of the Information Age, let alone change the course of history. 

This secret was just the right secret, a secret holding an ocean of secrets back from drowning the cities near. A dam containing a network of lies, some dark, others seemingly irrelevant, affecting each and every one of us. We shattered our beliefs and respected faiths almost immediately; because in this sense and others alike, humans behave like an interconnected family of organisms.

Jaya, like most organic machines of her time, was introduced to a biological agent upon awakening. Peacekeepers with SCARF (Strategic Crisis Aversion and Response Force) were awoken in cryo-cells. The cells were in rows and columns, stacked, towering beyond believable heights. There were at least 100 cryo-cells in her row alone. When she awoke to the sight before here, she
