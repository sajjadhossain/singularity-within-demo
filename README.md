## Independence Day
### Detroit, 04.07.2776

Today marks one-thousand years of independance in the United States. 

In its' usual tradition, the city of Detroit will echo with fireworks for a 10-kilometer radius. Towering buildings and tunneled roads will amplify the sound, causing bystanders to comfortably drop their guards to what normally induces fight or flight. The explosions alone hide a profusion of circumstances in plain sight. 

"...a special thanks to our sponsors: Bell-Telecomunnications, Bard Motor Company and the John & Johnson Family Company. Without further ado, Mayor Joseph Loppel."  The crowd applauds and the speaker disappears in blackout. By the other end of the dock, a single podium on a smaller stage lights up.

"Good evening." He spoke, breaking cheers.

"I would like to take a moment and extend my gratitude for all your support. We're all aware of the changes brought forth by the last few decades, but those eggs needed to be cracked..." He smiled and paused for the arc in their laugh to peak. Mayor Loppel was a charismatic rightist politician to say the least. Regardless of his partisanship, the very fiber of his being swayed the crowds' reverence.

"In the face of adversity and war *we* were resilient. When the responsibility to rebuild our nation was staring at us head on, *we* welcomed the challenge. That's why tonight, here at the Bard memorial in downtown Detroit, *we* remain standing on the grounds that revolutionized transportation eight-hundred and twenty-five years ago. That's why today, Motor City retains frontier-ship of the automative and space-faring industries." The crowd roars. Socialites and non-conformists alike seemed to be awestruck by the light of justice, silhouetting this hero.

He smiles and gestures order. "So, let us awe at a sky of bursting fireworks, celebrate our independence, and shine feeble in light of our future. Happy birthday America." 

With those last words Mayor Loppel took a seat with the rest of his cabinet members. A long whistle, then a tiny pop.
 
Three seconds later, a fusillade of fireworks filled the eager silence, retaining everyones attention. While the public occupied the boardwalk, the Mayor, attending founders and board members spectated from within the necessary protection of a clarion shield.

The show ended with a final barrage of explosions. 

Mayor Loppel, alongside his cohorts, lay pulseless in their seats. Their skin wrinkled, like tarnished leather fused with dry muscle and bone. The shield was intact, but all life within ceased in the same gruesome manner. It wasn't painful, just not pretty. It intended to raise neck-hairs, induce goosebumps at the very least. 

<div style="text-align:center">*******</div>

I smile. Impressed with my work.

I remind myself of how we choose to uphold a tradition that honors the mutilation and displacement of millions of people. I understand the difficulty in expressing empathy when subconsciously glued to our own interests and blind to the very hand that halts evolution. We placed ourselves at the center of the universe. What happened at the Library of Alexandria, Yucatan, China and Egypt before then only served as dry crops for the flame. It's true what they say:

> History is written by those that live to tell it. 

In simply staring at the floor behind me - a rooftop muddled with pebbles, mostly black, some reds, greens and in betweens - I know that every other arrangement of this seemingly random pattern exists for *this exact one* to exist. If the right people, at the right time, were to understand this simple, yet radical thought, maybe violence wouldn't be necessary. Maybe we'd be connected on a level beyond the surface, beyond blood.

I scoff at the by-product of evolution we call "self". A sense that is washed and cradled, only to later behave through a means of deeply-rooted calculations, unbeknownst to the host. Our ancestors would be ashamed at how much we've regressed. Does being aware make any difference?

Within seconds of asking herself that question, Jaya's mind raced with a million thoughts. She was overwhelmed, confused. "Wait!" She exclaims. "I'm talking to myself again... No... no, no." She starts pacing. "Not. This. Again." Stomping to emphasize each word, kicking up dust. 

She falls back from the ledge, finding difficulty to breathe. She disarms her weapon, tosses it over her right shoulder. The holster on her back sent a pulse to the registered weapon. It securely folded and snapped into a retro-fitted compartment, alongside a caché of weapons, gadgets and utilities. Hunched over her knees, she begins to hyper-ventilate.

The HUD readings were making her head spin. She takes off her helmet. It hisses and parts down the middle. The brute caliber of artillery and armor that plated her chest, back and limbs begin to frighten her. Desperately, she starts prying her suit open. Having no recollection of how to use it anymore, she used her weight as leverage to tear the chest away, further compromising pressure-integrity in the process. 

Her instincts told her to look for something behind the left abdomen. She feels around to find an object welded in to her bone. Above scar tissue, around the cavity, she felt a barcode of sorts. She traced it with her fingers, right-to-left. The embossed skin glowed from within. Sending a shock through her spine. 

"Argh... Aahh!!!" She screamed.

Her senses were hijacked momentarily. Her vision was obstructed with an opaque overlay. It prompted for a password. Without understanding how, her muscle memory gestured an accepted signature.

She felt a rush of information flooding her brain. Her senses, felt as if they were reviving from shell-shock. She looked up at the bay to notice panic spread throughout the audience. By then, authorities should have discovered a gap in their Closed Circuit Television recordings. There was 10-seconds of loop in place of what should've been signs of struggling for air. 

Jaya grabs her helmet and jumps in to the suit, leaps off the roof before the armor even solidifies around her. She lands on her toes, rippling the concrete below her. She crosses the sidewalk and enters her vehicle from the cargo area in the rear. A Chevron Puma, an armored truck with a programmable interface. To anyone else, it's just a beautiful machine. To Jaya, the vehicle was a partner, a spirit by the name of Leon. The locks clasp. The room is depressurized. Jaya takes off her helmet, kneels before it and the cacoon, resting her head on her knee.

"ID: Mars, Tango. Unit 781. Contact: Base." She spoke in to her chest. Microseconds later, her identification was confirmed, and an automated response system prompted her:  

"Report."

"Mission: Sierra, Papa, India, dash, two-two-nine-six." She sighed.

"Complete."

Leons' hind legs parted from the sides and kicked off the floor. Scaling walls and leaping beyond the roofs, then sky-scrapers. After clearing the blast radius, it shot towards the stars, leaving behind a ring of smoke and sonic tail. Jaya and Leon were heading towards high earth orbit, rendezvousing with other Descendants. 

## The Consultant
### I.S.S. DAWN, 27.02.3033

"C'mon! We saw this coming. This exact fucking..." 

"Sir, temper." Said an autonomous being from the back of the room, cutting off the Program Director. 

"We were aware of this exact epic. We mapped every parallel universe, filtered scenarios selectively based on probability and deduction. As we expected, it was a chemical-based attack using multiple ballistic devices. Someone speak to this. Ñederes?"

"I'm not completely sure. The event branched as expected, completing a story that we mapped. It checked out milestone for milestone. But upon further inspection, there are some differences in the scenarios that were executed. Rather, some scenarios weren't used." She paused to think.

"It's not obtuse to assume the assassin, led us to prioritize a particular set of milestones. Thus, making us focus on certain stories. Leaving room to leverage scenarios from other stories that overlap in completing the milestone." Ñederes wasn't human, even though her suit shaped her to appear more human. When she spoke, she spoke to the listeners' mind.

"Are you suggesting that the terrorists have Atlassian technology? Or can out wit our quantum-computations? Gull the very likes of you?" barked the Director.

"They can't know of our existence because our objective requires that to persist in the true state. The second most-latter was discussed as a caveat in quantum-computational theory itself. Unfortunately my academic knowledge on this topic is limited. I suggest bringing a more scholarly resource on board." 

The director grunted in her direction. She stood up and held her right arm up towards him. She was tall, almost brutish. Her three, large, tentacle-like fingers hovered over the space above his head. She waited for his permission.

"Go on."

Ñederes is Hydaian, from the Taurus Constellation. She was the youngest Interstellar Fleet Graduate to become Executive Officer. Her first campaign was with Capitan Hendricks of the I.S.S Dawn. Nineteen months in to her first mission, routine operations aboard her vessel were interrupted. Dawn was a research facility in orbit around VY Canis Majoris, a hypergiant star. The ship and its crew were currently occupied by the Galactic Archive and Intelligence Agency (GAIA). Ñederes and Captain Hendricks took orders from Program Director Charles Fredrich. 

Ñederes took Director Fredrich and Captain Hendricks to an event in the local time-space. A doctorate professor of Forensics focused in to their consciousness. The doctor that single-handly brought the science of deduction to Forensics and Criminology. After his studies, he aided in theorizing the deductive-user-story-model approach. The same methodologies used today as preventative measures for time-crimes by the Authority of Cross Time Dimensions (ACTD). The doctor had a name, but not one that everyone knew him by. Adoringly, he was referred to as Dr. Holmes.

### Cambridge University, 12.10.2126

"Since we first observed gravitational waves a little over a century ago, we revisited fundamental concepts of science in lieu of theories that will dramatically change our perception of the world around us. I have no doubt that *this* will play a huge role in the forthcoming revolution." Said the lecturer, holding a tiny chip.

"This quantum processor, matched with the right set of algorithms and conditionals, can recreate events at the sub-atomic level. Anyone care to take a stab at the possibilities this technology may lead to?" He asked the group of subjects staged for a virtal audience of roughly 500,000 people.

"Um... we can recreate events from the *future*?" Said a subject, unsure of the response. The crowd shared a brief, but loud, chuckle.

"I find it inspiring more-so than humorous." Retorted the professor, silencing the audience.

"What is time?" He continued. "To us, time behaves as an invisible force. There are laws and limitations to the ways in which it governs our existence. For centuries, we were aware of only *four* fundamental interactions determining how matter behaves in space..." Everyone buckled in for the whiplashing-climax of the lecture.

"...which brings us here today. We're aware of space-time and we know that gravity's role in space-time won't be replaced anytime soon, but how about another force? It's not far-fetched to assume there are quantum forces shaping the very fabric of our lives in a spectrum we cannot see." He paused.

"How do these forces fit in to our current models? Are we to ignore other factors that similarly govern matter at the subatomic-level? How does *this* force fit into our lives? Does it influence the past? The future?" He sweeped the audience, smiling at the cost of their curiosity.

The room remained silent. The rhetorical questions made everyone in attendance think existentially. Time seemed to stand still. For a micro-second, everything was withdrawn from their attention, barring one very acute thought.

"Did anyone feel that? Did time seem to *stop* for anyone here?" He asked the subjects.

"Yes," as he focused his line of sight on the subject raising her hand, her name and additional information flooded the space to her right. "Yohanna."

"I don't know if time stopped, but for some reason, after your pause, I was communicated... *a single string* of thought. I felt it with everyone here... the audience... subjects... even... you." She looked to the other subjects seeking affirmation. They nodded and returned full attention to the lecturer.

"It was indeed 'A single string'." He gestured the words on to his desk as he spoke them. The words were then streamed to the digital board behind him for the audience to read. Suddenly, the vision they all shared seconds ago, came to shape before their eyes.

"I shared these exact words, this exact event, this exact moment, with the entire lot of you." The stunning revelation left everyone without breath. The subjects, in pure disbelief.

"Subjects, recall your study from 6 sols ago. After agreeing to partake in the remaining lectures, you completed a relatively-brief survey." He smiled in sarcasm. The survey took the better half of two hours to complete.

"In the fine-printed addendum to your waivers, there is mention of an experiment. A study that will conclude 6-decades of research using quantum-computation to refine models of the Ravnighat-Edstrom formula. In other words, for the purpose of our experiment, anticipate and share exactly *one* micro-second of the future."

Everyone, including Dr. Niloy Ifthekar (Holmes), was taken aback. No one expected the experiment to provide such colorful results. Tangible data, in-the-flesh. He was ecstatic. These small wins reminded him that his work served a greater purpose, grand design. He gestured to another guest, hidden out of spot light. She hovered to the stage.

Dr. Alanis Pollux was his most enthused and respected under study. As she came in to spotlight, it became clear as to why she used the MIT Hoverchair. The entire lower half of her body, from her abdomen down was missing. The device allowed her to sit, stand, move around and work from the comfort of a single utility chair. It's aerodynamic aluminum body also conformed to her contour and style, safe to assume it was customized. 

"Please feel free to overwhelm Dr. Pollux with your questions and comments. After the convention, I will be available for book signings by the reception area. Thank you!" The croud gave him a standing ovation, as the press, alongside the virtual audience, began recapping the advancements detailed in this portion of the **ST2 Conference**. 

Dr. Ifthekar walked off stage, heading towards the green room to grab his belongings. He put on his coat and exited the convention center. He turned his coat collar against the wind, pulled out his nicotine-vaporizer and began to toke. He looked around the empty garden. The vapor replaced a fair portion of the oxygen in his lungs. The nicotine was digested by his lungs and spread throughout various cells, then carried up in to his brain. Neural receptors gladly accepted the cells' offerings. A deep breath later, his mind was clear of the frustrations and thoughts that would normally consume him.

Something wasn't right. At this hour, today of all days, the day his team unvieled the refined Ravnighat-Edstrom Space-Time (REST) Theory, he expected nonstop harrasment from the press and amatuer scientists alike. Especially in the public garden at Cambridge University. He walked towards the Stephen Hawking Center. Following the footsteps of the late astro-physicist, tracing the walls with his fingers, feeling the history deluge his emotions. "It's too quiet." He thought.

As he approched the steps of the monument honoring Dr. Hawking, his vision seemed to blur. He wiped his eyes dry of the tears caused by the cold wind. It took more than a few seconds for him to realize, but it wasn't his vision that was blurring. The matter that made up the space around him began fizzling in and out of existence. In unison, everything around him seemed to be vibrating.

Dr. Ifthekar fell to his knees, sheilding his eyes from the blinding light leaking from a single point a few meters ahead of him. His coattail riding in the wave of energy. He dropped his vaporizer. The light began to consume the space around him and before he knew it, he was in a purgatorial state. He looked up to see three unrecognizable figures before him.

"Hello, Doctor Holmes"

## Wampanoag
### North East America, c. 1421 A.D.E.S.

"Ilyare!" she screamed frantically. 

Ilyares' mom cradled her, holding the leather belt in her mouth. Her grinding teeth tearing at the buffalo hide. She began convulsing. To the tribe, Ilyare was cursed. Everyone thought that evil spirits would have their way with her when she was in this state.

Andyare, her mother, was in tears, gasping for deep breath. She pray the Gods relieve Ilyare of what she felt was punishment for her sins. Perhaps for abandoning prayer on occasion, commiting adultery with the non-local. Is that not enough to force Gods' wrath? Leaving her with bastard child, barely able live on own.

"My Ilyare..." she sobs, holding her daughters' head tight, close to her anguished heart. 

Ilyare is 6-years-old. She was born comatose. Concieved on the same ground she lay today. A bed of leaves, roots and soil, atop the mountain overlooking their previous settlement. Minutes pass and then the thought crossed Andyares' mind. "What if Ilyare feels no pain? What if the pain in my heart, is the only pain between us. What if the Gods are only borrowing you? My sweet princess." 

"Your special mind." She whispers to her daughter.

Andyare gave in to that hope. That single ray of sun beyond a clouded sky. Dreaming. Entranced by the conviction that whatever is happening to Ilyare, is a part of a greater plan. With every moment that passed, Andyare held her daughter closer. The sun set 12° when Ilyare returned to her normal, non-convulsing, vegitative state. 

She lay still. In every sense of the word, nonplussed, by the world around her. Her mind wasn't there with mother. She was fixed to a lucid dream or reality outside everyone elses' purview. Mother, folded over her daughter who lay moored to the earth. The sun bathed their skin as it crept through the canopy of leaves, branches and lush forestry surrounding them. It was quiet for that moment. No birds. No critters. No noise. Just them. 

Ilyares' body remained still, only occasional movement came from her eyes, from underneath her thin eyelids. As if she was in the REM cycle of a normal nights slumber. Her body from the chest down was apart of the earth. Her arms, from below the elbow, were tree roots, digging in to the earth. Andyare assumed that was how her body remained nourished, feeding on sugars in the earth. 

Ilyares' facial features closely resembled her mothers'. However, everything else seemed to be a genetic copy of her father. Her body was hairless, pale blue, with darker hues of stripes and markings around her face and arms. Her eyes, when she chose to open them, were as white as the sun. Her gills, clotted with dirt and dust.

Andyare looked up. Wondering what's become of Yårun. Her lover. He left this earth as fast as he came. Andyare is not bitter from his departure, just hoping for his safety and betterment. "He saved me." She thought. Unlike other women of her tribe, Andyare was weak, showing little-to-no signs of alphaism. She was the living epitome of a damzel in distress. Fonder of the men in the tribe, who gossiped, cooked and harvested plants while the women sought prey. 

Andyare also identified more with the male figure, small, petite and slim around the waist. Jokingly, the tribe reffered to her as the linguistic equivelant of a man-girl. "T'sak-namarun". At age 9, she was already towered and overpowered by other females of her age. Her figure was uncommon for females from that specific lineage.

For centuries, the Heir-Chamarayan, a sect of the Wapanoag which she belonged to, chose to selectively breed women based on preferable traits like strategic depth, chauvanism, stregnth, loyalty and charisma. It is rumored that their culture originated in another part of the world, the Amazon. Their differences led to their exile, so they sought refuge in deep areas of uncharted forests.

Not before long, stories about the Heir-Chamarayan, like the Amazonians before them, became a myth. 

<div style="text-align:center">*******</div>

Andyare was frightened for her life. She stumbled her way to a clearing in the forest, dropping her shield along the way. Within seconds, the Hexaped-Apes surrounded her. She was only 10-years-old. She wondered why the Gods chose to make her a female, at least in the biological sense. As she reached for her gold-plated shield, the alpha male gnarled and barked at her. She retreated.

"Fuck, fuck. I'm dead..." she cowered. It was in all truth the most plausible scenario. As it is, roughly 20% of the women that undergo this test don't leave a body for their loved ones to bury, let alone her weak manly self. She back pedaled in to a stone wall. Cornered. In every sense of the word. The alpha began approaching her, with it, the rest of the pack sidled towards her. She covered her face and braced herself.

"Thwat, shkoom, thud." She peeked through a small openining in her fingers, she had no idea what was happening. She removed her hands from her face slowly. It was a blur of motions. What seemed like a blue, mysteriously shaped, figure, dishing out pain in ways shes never seen before. It was as if the figure was keen of the apes offensive and defensive mechanisms. It was a dance. She was enchanted, and before she knew it, she found her self awestruck, arms at her side, mouth wide-open and dry from disbelief.

The figure made no noise as it danced around the apes, using Andyares' shield both as a weapon and for self-defense. Its' precision was unlike anything she seen before. It used its' dexterous long toes to pick up a large rock at its' hind, while shielding a blow from the aplha ape ahead. It then jumped and kicked the aplha in the abdominal with the foot free of the rock, skillfully disabling the creature with no intent to kill it. In that single jump, it roundhouse-lunged the rock towards the beta ape almost 20 meters away. The ape was struck in the chest, flying back from the sheer force, knocking down a handful of other apes on it's way back.

With the alpha and beta apes unconcious, the pack retreated in fear. 

The figure then waited a moment, making sure the area was clear of all threats. Was it smelling the air? At arms length the figure loomed over her. It was narrow at its waist, but its' chest... its' chest was so wide. The creatures wingspan was longer than its' height. Its' torso was short. It was missing a naval cavity and nipples. 

The markings on its chest, arms and face pointed inward, like the stripes you would see on a tiger or zebra. Whatever it was, it wasn't human. The being turned to look over its' shoulder, nasal cavities flared, eyes wide and attentive. There was movement 30 meters across the field. It was the proctors. Andyare most definately failed the test; she didn't know what they were going to do with her. 

The being scratched a handful of letters in to the dirt between them, laid the shield on the floor then leaped towards the canopy, grappling onto the vines and branches, disappearing from sight without noise. She leaned in to read the note the being left behind, it was in her native toungue. How?

"Ya-arun"

Was that... its' name?

The rustling in the bushes grew closer. Andyare wiped the message away with her feet, grabbed her shield and prepared herself for the interrogation that will most definately follow.

<div style="text-align:center">*******</div>

She quickly snapped back in to reality when Ilyare began convulsing again. After a few tense spasms, Ilyare was still again, this time her eyes and mouth remained open. White  beams shot from her eyes, shooting towards the sky. Like thin pillars of light. Andyare followed the light to its peak. Dust and smoke swimming through it. Its' pinnacle aligned with the Orion constellation, barely visible in the young night sky.


## Ma'at
### Greater Mesopotamic Region, c. 10116 B.C.E.S.

The young man stood on the edge of platform overlooking the delta of the Nile. Worried and concerned, it's clear his attention was elsewhere.

"Chart course for Desouk, I have words for Geb, Nut, Seth and Ra. Summon the Great Council... they should bear witness." He instructed the slave to leave his presence. 

The jewelry stitched to his arm, rubbed against the cloth draped around his neck and waist. The rustle of the fabrics chimed a melodic tone. He was donning extortionate attire, barring no room for lesser-classmanship. His chariot awaited. Designed for horses his lineage selectively bred. The tamed-beast was ornamented with precious stones and jewels. 

For a millenia, the Nimistri
"Yaah!" He roars as the whip cracked. 

He prepared for inertia, a symptom of traveling at ferocious speeds, other symptoms include nausea and muscle fatigue. The horse neighs', springing in to an impetus march. A trek this exhaustive demanded many sharpened skills. Navigation in these conditions alone require a through mapping of night skies, weather patterns and local geology. The horse required methodical attention to avoid strain. Even with enough supplies, he knew the 35-days to follow were going to be brutal at best. But for the sake of his family, he had a responsibility.

On the fourteenth day, signs of a storm were at his tail, making steady way towards him. In need to pitch camp, he looked around. He found a canyonous break between two sand-erroded hills of rock. He pulled the right leash, forcing his horse to dive towards the debateable cavity. The storm came over them in no time. He got off his horse and anchored it to a neighboring rock. The sand around him became mud. A few steps over, hidden from sight, was the edge of a Herculean cliff. Valleys channeled out of mountainous plateus in all directions. The sky above and the land between him and the plateau ahead was dark. Shadowed by the storm. If he looked far enough, he can see in to the future. Where the storm has not yet touched.

Egypt is not dry and dusty as one would imagine, its' land fertile, seas' enriched with eukaryotes.

### WORK IN PROGRESS

Dr. Ifthekar used a Highlighter to direct the subjects' attention to a projection on his left. The highlighter used visible-electromagetic waves to envelop an object that is defined when the user focuses their sans-peripheral vision. It was a single helix of DNA, amongst a table of two rows and eight columns. There was a DNA hologram for each of the 16 subjects of the experiment. 

He continued to explain how the survey completed earlier provided a deductive-traceback for each of the participants, agnostically, respective to their individual lives. He magnified parts in the helix, that were molded by their experiences. He factored the aforementioned variables in to Edstrom equations, a scale that seemed infinite. For the sake of brevity, he withdrew the excruciating detail behind his calculations. Dr. Ifthekar took a seat, allowing Dr. Priyanka Ravnighat to take the stage and expand on a field she lead.

"Not long ago, a physician stumbled upon inadmissible evidence suggesting we live in a universe governed by super-string theory. Now, it's the very backbone of every major scientific-breakthrough, religion and philosophy. Our star-faring capability is burgeoning, yet we've seen exponential growth in day-to-day and military technology. Collectively, we have a stable economy, a democratic state, tell-tale signs of a civilization that will evolve past Level-0" She paused. Meeting everyone's eye to make sure she is being understood. 

"Every single experience, every charged or non-charged particle, every photon of light or absence, plays a *major* role in defining how space and time is percieved. Ripples tracing back to very factors  that compose society, civilization, *this* moment at the sub atomic-level." Another strategic pause.

### WORK IN PROGRESS
We waited for each other. We shared memories and emotions across gaps in space and time. So much time passed until the first descendant understood the gravity of this discovery. Our alienating conditions, are actually a gift from evolution. The underlying lesson being that evolution requires sacrifices. To a species that's not driven by emotion, sacrifices equate to death, but our survival was stringent on chaotic misfortune and selective breeding.

The Revan-Edstrom Experiment specifically was the first secretive experiment to be documented and discussed openly during its time. Its almost impossible that a revelation would mark the latter half of the Information Age, let alone change the course of history. 

This secret was just the right secret, a secret holding an ocean of secrets back from drowning the cities near. A dam containing a network of lies, some dark, others seemingly irrelevant, affecting each and every one of us.
